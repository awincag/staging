                  <p>According to conventionindustry.org, 205 Million people in the United States attend "the 1.8M conventions, conferences, congresses, trade shows and exhibitions, incentive events and corporate/business meetings" each year.</p>
                  <p>How often would you say that when you go to a conference, you were able to capitalize and maximize the value of that trip? Were you able to get all those business cards you wanted? Were you able to keep track of all the events you wanted to go to? Did you have to read through a crumpled up, back-pocket worn conference guide?</p>
                  <p>Nvolv aims to solve for all those problems. By creating a bespoke conference mobile application, conference organizers can leverage the platform to push content and information, connect attendenees, and create an infrastructure for sponsors to help leverage their brand.</p>

                <p>Utilizing a variation of Google's Design Sprint, Jackie and myself worked in extremely close collaboration with the client over a period of 2 weeks. Typically, we have clients come in the first couple of days to kick off the project. However, for Nvolv, the client was working with us everyday, embedded into our workflow.</p>
                <p>To kick off the project, we started out aiming to understand the core problems and metrics that were going to drive all design decisions and structures. After a very long day's session discussioning the merits and pitfalls of the various business strategies, we chose 2 core phases: (1) Attendee and (2) Sponsor Experience. We focused on three key metrics for each experience.</p>

              <p>Octane AI had a successful beta launch and quickly raised a series A round. However, some of their beta users include: 50 Cent, Aerosmith, Kiss, 30 Seconds to Mars, SPiN and Magic Mike Live. Their current focus is to market to content producers and publishers to manage their high volume of fans. The successful beta launch of their MVP allowed Octane AI to raise a significant amount of capital to slowly start building out their team. They currently have a team of 10 designing out building the product further. Excited to see where this goes in the future.</p>
