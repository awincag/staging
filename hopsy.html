            <p>Did you know that over 90% of the beers in your local grocery store chain is owned by only 4 main beer brands? Most craft breweries are owned by one of the four large beer conglomerates. Hopsy is here to offset the mass-owned beer by providing access to local, fresh, craft beer.</p>
            <p>Started in 2015, Hopsy established partnered with local Bay Area nano breweries to provide better access to the great beers that come out of them. Since then, they've created a fantastic off-line presence with companies throughout the Bay Area, but their digital presence needed work. West Agile Labs and Hopsy partnered in winter of 2016/2017 to redesign their digital storefront.</p>
            <p>I oversaw the re-design of their digital ecommerce store. Annie Pyle and Jackie Cruickshank helped on the design and art direction, respectively. Our primary goals of the design were to help customers find the right beer more accurately, increase conversion and promote Hopsy's subscription service.</p>

              <p>With an emphasis on conversion, that meant two things: ensuring customers could feel confident when choosing their beer and decreasing the effort needed to purchase that beer. Hopsy intially had their beer described by it's IBU's and ABV. They also included price, brewery, beer type and an 'add to cart' button. We found that majority of people didn't correlate IBU's and ABV to flavor profile. After that discovery, we update each beer SKU to include beer type, brewery, flavor profile, ABV and a combined price / add to cart button, to all the limited real-estate to breathe. Including flavor profiles enables customers to quickly understand if that's a beer they're looking for.</p>
              <p>Initially at 6 stepsâ€”account creation, account information, delivery address, billing address, delivery method, payment information, the cart and checkout process made it cumbersome to quickly order your beer. Rathan than have a cart and 'review cart' at the beginning of a checkout, we designed the cart as the first step of the checkout process, eliminating the need to see a cart twice.</p>
              <p>We designed a delivery method screen that ensures that a customer only needs to put in relevant information. The previous solution required a delivery address even if a customer was doing store pickup. Furthermore, the delivery options we dependent on a zip code only, not the full delivery address. We addressed that in the design as well.</p>
              <p>Payment methods can require anything from CC and full billing details to just CC and zipcode. We opted for the later given that there had been zero cases of CC fraud. Lastly, for new and guest users, they simply had to add a password to create an account for future use, eliminating the step where users needed to create an account before finishing their order.
              <p>This ultimately brought their checkout process from 7 full steps to 4. For returning users they could check out in under 4 clicks and feel confident about their beer purchase. This vastly reduced the barrier for tasting great fresh, local beer. </p>
