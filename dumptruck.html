            <p>Over 1 billion people use Facebook messenger every month. That's more than Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter combined. At the moment, there's no sign of it slowing down. With publishers and content creators amassing fan bases as large as 34m+ followers like  Aerosmith, building chatbots provides an opportunity to engage your audience on a mass scale like never before.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of fall 2016, Matt Schilitcht, Ben Parr, and Leif K-Brooks saw this huge market opportunity to design and build a technology to allow anyone, with or without a chatbot. After an exhaustive search, they partnered with West Agile Labs to help build out their vision of a more automated and connected messaging platform.</p>
            <p>I oversaw the design efforts for simplifying the complex nature of chatbots. Branding and art direction was driven by Jackie Cruickshank while I lead product and interaction design with help from Danielle Hadley. With a focus on iterative prototyping and testing, we were able to design a fully responsive chatbot management platform in under 2 months. Octane AI had a successful private launch 2 months later with industry leading publishers joining the platform and a series A raise.</p>

            <p>Due to the complex nature of chatbots and artificial intelligence, the core focus of the project was to simplify and humanize every step of creating a chatbot. The solution needed to clearly articulate how it was being built and what that meant for people interacting with it. This was the primary driver of every design decision.</p>
            <p>After 7 rounds of low fidelity wireframes and usability tests, we designed a solution that allowed people to build a chatbot piece by piece, tailored to their needs. This solution came in the form of plugins that allows users to which type of content they'd like their audience to interact with. Plugins can manifest as notifications and messaging-allowing chatbots to blast a users updates to their audience, generate launch campaigns to promote upcoming events or content, or showcase merchandise to sell a users's latest items. Each plugin has it's own unique construction, whether it be messaging, images, content integrations (e.g, Spotify, Ticketmaster, Soundcloud, YouTube) or links that allow content to be pushed down to the audience. Ultimatley, the deconstruction of a chatbot into plugins allows for a step by step walkthrough eliminating and confusion when building your chatbot. Lastly, each plugin has a set of defaults that allows users to quickly build and edit from a template without every having to worry about starting completely from scratch.</p>

              <p>dumptruck was built late 2013 as a non-responsive, relatively simple CMS site that allowed for displaying of events and '1-click' quotes. While '1-click' quotes are great for the user, doing this at volume became difficult and time-consuming. The office assistant, company ops or event planner who needed to get proposals for 4-5 events would have to browse and find multiple events, go into their product pages, request the proposal, and continue the process again. Our focus quickly shifted from presenting a better information on the events page to how can people more effectively get volume. After discussing with 50 or so repeat event bookers, it became very evident that people were less concerned with the nitty gritty of the event, and more worried about making it operationally possible, specifically with budget and schedule. I mean, if someone says “hey do you want to go kayaking, skydiving, paintballing or lazer tag”, you most likely already know what the event is about, then it just comes down to when can it work. </p>
