              <p>"Booking events is hard. Booking events for a lot of people is harder. Booking events for your team takes time. Having 15 people tell you want they want makes it harder. Booking events within budget is hard. Trying to get proposals from multiple event vendors to stay within budget making sure people are happy and content and fulfilled in the time frame needed... well that's ******* hard. </p>
              <p>Trying to do all of that and book events has been a pain in the ass for anyone who does them. There are full-time jobs dedicated to people for people to find the right vendor, the right venue, the right activities all within the right budget and timeframe. For small and medium businesses and teams, this becomes a nightmare. Adding in catering and transporation and event pages, yeah... we needed that too. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, how do we simplify that process for SMB's to quickly find events and book them with all their constraints."</p>

              <p>Dumptruck was built late 2013 as a non-responsive, relatively simple CMS site that allowed for displaying of events and '1-click' quotes. While '1-click' quotes are great for the user, doing this at volume became difficult and time-consuming. The office assistant, company ops or event planner who needed to get proposals for 4-5 events would have to browse and find multiple events, go into their product pages, request the proposal, and continue the process again. Our focus quickly shifted from presenting a better information on the events page to how can people more effectively get volume. After discussing with 50 or so repeat event bookers, it became very evident that people were less concerned with the nitty gritty of the event, and more worried about making it operationally possible, specifically with budget and schedule. I mean, if someone says “hey do you want to go kayaking, skydiving, paintballing or lazer tag”, you most likely already know what the event is about, then it just comes down to when can it work. </p>
              <p>When we started, they just finished a rebrand but needed help with improving the product. It became very evident that the biggest issue for users was browsing events and requesting multiple proposals at any given time. </p>
              <p>After 3 large iterations and usability testing, I was able to take their existing layout and create a responsive booking flor for instant quote requests across multiple events within the attendee's requirements. Additionally, we were able to build out the booking flow for individual events to cater for venue booking, transporation, packages and any additional add-ons that could improve the team building experience. </p>
              <p>To note, we also added the ability for users to version their proposals. Often, event bookers need to understand the legalities and intracacies of the proposals. If the initial proposal is rejected by the budgeting staff, having the ability to manage the various proposals has been a huge hit. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>dumptruck was built late 2013 as a non-responsive, relatively simple CMS site that allowed for displaying of events and '1-click' quotes. While '1-click' quotes are great for the user, doing this at volume became difficult and time-consuming. The office assistant, company ops or event planner who needed to get proposals for 4-5 events would have to browse and find multiple events, go into their product pages, request the proposal, and continue the process again. Our focus quickly shifted from presenting a better information on the events page to how can people more effectively get volume. After discussing with 50 or so repeat event bookers, it became very evident that people were less concerned with the nitty gritty of the event, and more worried about making it operationally possible, specifically with budget and schedule. I mean, if someone says “hey do you want to go kayaking, skydiving, paintballing or lazer tag”, you most likely already know what the event is about, then it just comes down to when can it work. </p>
              <p>When we started, they just finished a rebrand but needed help with improving the product. It became very evident that the biggest issue for users was browsing events and requesting multiple proposals at any given time. </p>
              <p>After 3 large iterations and usability testing, I was able to take their existing layout and create a responsive booking flor for instant quote requests across multiple events within the attendee's requirements. Additionally, we were able to build out the booking flow for individual events to cater for venue booking, transporation, packages and any additional add-ons that could improve the team building experience. </p>
              <p>To note, we also added the ability for users to version their proposals. Often, event bookers need to understand the legalities and intracacies of the proposals. If the initial proposal is rejected by the budgeting staff, having the ability to manage the various proposals has been a huge hit. </p>
