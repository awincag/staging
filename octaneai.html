              <p>Over 1 billion people use Facebook messenger every month. That's more than Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter combined. At the moment, there's no sign of it slowing down. With publishers and content creators amassing fan bases as large as 34m+ followers like  Aerosmith, building chatbots provides an opportunity to engage your audience on a mass scale like never before.</p>
              <p>At the beginning of fall 2016, Matt Schilitcht, Ben Parr, and Leif K-Brooks saw this huge market opportunity to design and build a technology to allow anyone, with or without a chatbot. After an exhaustive search, they partnered with West Agile Labs to help build out their vision of a more automated and connected messaging platform.</p>
              <p>I oversaw the design efforts for simplifying the complex nature of chatbots. Branding and art direction was driven by Jackie Cruickshank while I lead product and interaction design with help from Danielle Hadley. With a focus on iterative prototyping and testing, we were able to design a fully responsive chatbot management platform in under 2 months. Octane AI had a successful private launch 2 months later with industry leading publishers joining the platform and a series A raise.</p>

              <p>Due to the complex nature of chatbots and artificial intelligence, the core focus of the project was to simplify and humanize every step of creating a chatbot. The solution needed to clearly articulate how it was being built and what that meant for people interacting with it. This was the primary driver of every design decision.</p>
              <p>After 7 rounds of low fidelity wireframes and usability tests, we designed a solution that allowed people to build a chatbot piece by piece, tailored to their needs. This solution came in the form of plugins that allows users to which type of content they'd like their audience to interact with. Plugins can manifest as notifications and messaging-allowing chatbots to blast a users updates to their audience, generate launch campaigns to promote upcoming events or content, or showcase merchandise to sell a users's latest items. Each plugin has it's own unique construction, whether it be messaging, images, content integrations (e.g, Spotify, Ticketmaster, Soundcloud, YouTube) or links that allow content to be pushed down to the audience. Ultimatley, the deconstruction of a chatbot into plugins allows for a step by step walkthrough eliminating and confusion when building your chatbot. Lastly, each plugin has a set of defaults that allows users to quickly build and edit from a template without every having to worry about starting completely from scratch.</p>

              <p>Octane AI had a successful beta launch and quickly raised a series A round. However, some of their beta users include: 50 Cent, Aerosmith, Kiss, 30 Seconds to Mars, SPiN and Magic Mike Live. Their current focus is to market to content producers and publishers to manage their high volume of fans. The successful beta launch of their MVP allowed Octane AI to raise a significant amount of capital to slowly start building out their team. They currently have a team of 10 designing out building the product further. Excited to see where this goes in the future.</p>
